### Day -1: September 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Just decided to do the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I have projects to do but they are large. I am working my way into new to me technologies

### Day 0: September 24, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Explore IBM Watson.

**Thoughts**: Have not looked at Watsn at all. First impressions, works with unstructured data = less work to get information out. Works with less data = how can we have best of all worlds.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
