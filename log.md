# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: September 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Just decided to do the challenge.

**Thoughts:** I have projects to do but they are large. I am working my way into new to me technologies 
and working through many different new prolems should help with this journey.

### Day 0: September 24, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
